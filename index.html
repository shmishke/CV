          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            I am a skilled Frontend Developer with nearly 3 years of hands-on
            experience working on live projects. My expertise lies in building
            responsive, dynamic, and user-friendly web applications. I have a
            strong foundation in JavaScript and a deep understanding of the
            React ecosystem, including global state management tools like
            Redux-Saga and Context API. My skills extend to unit testing and
            end-to-end (E2E) testing using Playwright to ensure the reliability
            and performance of applications. I have experience working in Scrum
            teams and am fluent in English, which has enhanced my ability to
            collaborate effectively in diverse, international settings. I am
            passionate about creating efficient and scalable solutions,
            continuously refining my skills to stay up to date with modern web
            development practices. I bring both technical proficiency and a
            collaborative mindset to every project.
